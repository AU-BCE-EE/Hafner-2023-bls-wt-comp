# Overview
This repo contains (nearly) all the data and data processing scripts needed to produce the results presented in the paper listed above.
The scripts run in R (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and require several add-on packages.
These packages are listed in multiple `packages.R` in `script-*` directories.
Versions of R and packages can be found in two `logs/R-versions-*.txt` files.
The ALFAM2 R package is from <https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2> (and installation details can be found there), but all others are available on CRAN.

Scripts for calculation of emission data from raw bLS and wind tunnel measurements are included, but data files are too large and are not included. 
However all resulting emission measurements can be found in `data-emission`.
These data in `data-emission` are from the ALFAM2 database, and were used for all plots and analyses presented in the paper.
These bLS data processing files include some MATLAB scripts.

# Directory structure

## `data-emission`
Measurement data in `data` subdirectory.
These are downloaded from a specific release (based on tag) from ALFAM2-data repo on GitHub (<github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2-data/>).
(Version is given in `data-emission/scripts/main.R` and `data-emission/logs/data_version.txt`, which was downloaded from the ALFAM2-data repo.)
See `data-emission/scripts` for R scripts for downloading data.
`main.R` calls the others to do the complete dataload, subsetting, and save.

## `data-pH`
Measurement data on pH of surface of applied slurry.
Used by scripts in `scripts-pH`.

## `functions`
Functions used by various scripts.

## `logs`
Logs of R package versions, parameter values, and more to try to ensure reproducibility.

## `output`
Output summaries and similar files.
See section below on links to paper to locate sources of paper components.

## `plots-ALFAM2`
Plots produced by scripts in `scripts-ALFAM2`, on application of ALFAM2 model to emission trials.

## `plots-meas`
Plots of measured emission and weather, produced by scripts in `scripts-meas`.

## `plots-pH`
Plots of surface pH, produced by scripts in `scripts-pH`.

## `scripts-ALFAM2`
Scripts on application of ALFAM2 model to emission trials.
The script `main.R` calls all others.

## `scripts-bLS`
MATLAB and R scripts for processing bLS data to calculate measured ammonia emission.
The bLS model is run in R with bLSmodelR.r package (https://github.com/ChHaeni/bLSmodelR).
Processing is conducted in MATLAB. 
Data files are too large to include but scripts are still included here for partial reproducibility.

## `scripts-meas`
Scripts for working with emission measurements and producing plots.
The script `main.R` calls all others.

## `scripts-pH`
Scripts for producing surface pH plots.
The script `main.R` calls all others.

## `scripts-WT`
R scripts for processing WT data to calculate measured ammonia emission. 
Data files are too large to include but scripts are still included here for partial reproducibility.
The script `main.R` calls all others. 

## `workspace-ALFAM2`
Copy of latest workspace created by running `scripts-ALFAM2/main.R`.
Saved simply because it can be convenient to avoid running time-consuming model optimization, especially bootstrap analysis that can take hours.

Table S1 set 2 part comes from the `alfam2pars02` object in v2.0 of the ALFAM2 package (here: <https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2/releases/tag/v2.0>. 
Note that parameter set E (in manuscript) is called set b in the scripts.
Set a in the scripts is not mentioned in the manuscript.

Section 3.1 states "Wind tunnel air exchange rate (AER) had a clear effect on measured emission, with a similar response in the two trials where it varied widely (p = 1Â·10-5 for AER effect, p = 0.99 for interaction based on an F test from a regression model)." come from results from `summary(m1)` or `drop1(m1, test = 'F')` (for main AER effect) and similar for `m2` (for interation) in `output/stats.pdf`, which is created by `scripts-meas/stats.Rmd`.

Section 2.3.2 info on gap filling ("...with filtered data removed...") is from `gapeffect` column in `output/emis_summ.csv`, which is generated by scripts `scripts-meas/summary.R` and `scripts-meas/export.R`.

Plot keys (pmid) in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 come from `output/pmid_summ.csv`, which is just a column subset of `pdat` created in `scripts-meas/summary.R` and exported in `scripts-meas/export.R`.
More detailed information on pmid (linking to trials and conditions) is also in `output/emis_summ.csv` and `output/int_summ.csv` from `scripts-meas/export.R`.
