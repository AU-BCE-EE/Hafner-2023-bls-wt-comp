# Directory structure

## `data-emission`
Measurement data in `data` subdirectory.
These are downloaded from a specific release (based on tag) from ALFAM2-data repo on GitHub.
See `data-emission/scripts` for R scripts for downloading data.
`main.R` calls the others to do the complete dataload, subsetting, and save.

## `data-pH`
Measurement data on pH of surface of applied slurry.
Used by scripts in `scripts-pH`.

## `functions`
Functions used by various scripts.

## `logs`
Logs of R package versions, parameter values, and more to try to ensure reproducibility.

## `output`
Output summaries and similar files.
See section below on links to paper to located sources of paper components.

## `plots-ALFAM2`
Plots produced by scripts in `scripts-ALFAM2`, on application of ALFAM2 model to emission trials.

## `plots-meas`
Plots of measured emission and weather, produced by scripts in `scripts-meas`.

## `plots-pH`
Plots of surface pH, produced by scripts in `scripts-pH`.

## `scripts-ALFAM2`
Scripts on application of ALFAM2 model to emission trials.
The script `main.R` calls all others.

## `scripts-meas`
Scripts for working with emission measurements and producing plots.
The script `main.R` calls all others.

## `scripts-pH`
Scripts for producing surface pH plots.
The script `main.R` calls all others.

## `Workspace-ALFAM2`
Copy of latest workspace created by running `scripts-ALFAM2/main.R`.
Saved simply because it can be convenient to avoid running lengthy model optimization, especially bootstrap analysis that can take hours.

Note that parameter set X (in manuscript) is called set b in the scripts.
Set a in the scripts is not mentioned in the manuscript.

Section 3.1 stats "Wind tunnel air exchange rate (AER) had a clear effect on measured emission, with a similar response in the two trials where it varied widely (p = 1Â·10-5 for AER effect, p = 0.99 for interaction based on an F test from a regression model)." come from results from `aov(m2)` in `output/stats.pdf`, which is created by `scripts-meas/stats.Rmd`.

Section 2.3.2 info on gap filling is from `output/emis_summ.csv`, which comes from scripts `scripts-meas/summary.R` and `scripts-meas/export.R`.

Plot keys (pmid) in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 come from `output/pmid_summ.csv`, which is just a column subset of `pdat` created in `scripts-meas/summary.R` and exported in `scripts-meas/export.R`.
pmid info is also in `output/emis_summ.csv` and `output/int_summ.csv` from `scripts-meas/export.R`.
