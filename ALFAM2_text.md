# 1 vs. 2
Set 1 of ALFAM2 calculations are based on parameter estimation applied to each individual plot.
Results show the best possible fit of the model, and therefore, highlight limitations of model structure.
Set 2 is based on a single parameter set, where wind tunnel and bLS predictions differ only through r1 and r3 parameters, reflecting the expected difference in mass transfer for the two systems.

Both parameter sets perform well after approximately 12 hours, but
